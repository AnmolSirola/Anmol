-  I am contributing to NFT-Toolbox project, which is an NPM package that allows seamless integration of all NFT-related  functionalities in Web2 projects.

- My current task is to improve the existing stuff with multi-chain support like Solana, Tezos, Aptos and Flow and also add more ERC's support, make different types of on-chain and off-chain algorithms for super fast batch minting of NFT.
